Mission Statement

1971 P.E. is a limited edition streetwear line of BRUJAS. 1971 was founded in July of 2016 as an experiment to see if it is possible to materially support our friends being locked up and criminalized through cultural production. We launched as a pilot project through Kickstarter in conjunction with the national prisoner strike in fall of 2016, and will continue to support the resistance of people behind bars as long as we exist.

Co-founded by Arianna Gil and Isabelle Nastasia. Designed by emerging artists VINNY6NAMES of Nocturnal Sons Posse and Robin Giordani of BRUJAS and The Corner Society.

Design 
 
The initial run is inspired by prison rebels, deviants, and the brujas of the past, present and future. The words featured on 1971 two-piece are references to the writing of Neal Shirley, Angela Y. Davis, and the FTTP periodical, and the designs are inspired by uprisings inside of prisons: from Attica in 1971 and the Bedford Hills Women’s Correctional Facility riot in New York in 1974, to the queer prisoner who started a fire in a segregation unit at Holman in Alabama in 2015, to the prisoner work stoppages taking place across the country this past month. 

How did we do it?

To all our backers and supporters who are interested in what proceeds after production and shipping looked like check out our costs sheet, showing how and where funds were distributed. This also serves as a pretty cool guide to understanding the components that make a project like this possible, we hope it is useful to co-conspirators.

How can I cop this look?
Soon, friend. Keep checking back.

Acclaim
1971’s Kickstarter was considered the most successful radical crowdfunding Kickstarter project in history by our peers.
