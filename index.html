              <p>
                In generations past people not so different from you or me attempted to fight the
                government, build alternatives to the dominant power structure, and defend their
                communities with arms and ideas alike. Some cooked their neighbors breakfast and
                organized political education, while others robbed banks and broke their sisters out
                of prison. Some made art and wrote communiques, took care of each other's children, or
                fundraised. A lot of this work remains integral parts of our resistance movements
                against white supremacy and capitalism. But over the last fifty years, the
                institutions that govern our lives, the bureaucracies that dictate what resources we
                have access to, and the cages we are thrown into if we disobey have become even more
                insidious. This is where we are today, attempting to answer these questions together:
                How do we break our loved ones out of jail if our communities are rapidly transforming
                into open-air prisons? How do we resist and thwart widespread surveillance and
                policing? How do we kill the cop in our own heads? What does it look like to create a
                world where "Black lives matter" and defend that space from opposing forces? What
                would it really mean to beat back fascism? These are the questions and ideas that
                shaped this project. The first run of 1971 streetwear was a wildly successful
                experiment to see if it is possible with the help of a small group of friends to
                materially support people who are criminalized and locked up by the state through
                cultural production.

                the initial run is inspired by prison rebels, deviants, and the brujas of the past,
                present and future. 1971 was inspired by the events that occurred on September 9,
                1971. 1,000 prisoners, most of them black and brown, rioted and seized control of
                Attica prison in New York. After four days of negotiations and taking hostages,
                authorities agreed to 28 of the prisoners' demands such as better medical treatment,
                fair visitation rights, and an end to physical brutality. 45 years later, prisoners
                launched a national work strike demanding an end to prison slavery, which entered
                its second consecutive month during the launch of the project, October, 2016.

                To all our backers and supporters who are interested in what profits after
                production &amp; shipping looked like check out our costs sheet, showing how and
                where funds were distributed. This also serves as a pretty cool guide to
                understanding the components that make a project like this possible, we hope it is
                useful for our co-conspirators who are interested in doing similar projects!
